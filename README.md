## 🔍 Abstract

Access to quality education remains a major barrier for students in underserved communities. Limited infrastructure, teacher shortages, and lack of personalized support make learning difficult. This paper explores how AI-powered chatbots can bridge the educational divide by offering on-demand, accessible, and interactive learning experiences. Using tools like GPT-based conversational agents, we propose a low-cost solution tailored for low-income students. The approach supports subjects like math, science, and language, and can be deployed via common messaging platforms like WhatsApp or web chat. The proposed solution has the potential to empower students with 24/7 academic help and improve learning outcomes in resource-limited environments.
